            "Walter Burkert among others suggests that the archaic groups or societies of lesser gods mirror real cult associations: \"It may be surmised that smith guilds lie behind Cabeiri, Idaian Dactyloi, Telchines, and Cyclopes.\"[15] Given their penchant for blacksmithing, many scholars believe the legend of the cyclopes' single eye arose from an actual practice of blacksmiths wearing an eyepatch over one eye to prevent flying sparks from blinding them in both eyes",
            "The cyclopes seen in Homer's Odyssey are of a different type from those in the Theogony and they have no connection to blacksmithing. It is possible that independent legends associated with Polyphemus did not make him a cyclops before Homer's Odyssey; Polyphemus may have been some sort of local daemon or monster in original stories.",
            "Another possible origin for the cyclops legend, advanced by the paleontologist Othenio Abel in 1914,[16] is the prehistoric dwarf elephant skulls – about twice the size of a human skull – that may have been found by the Greeks on Cyprus, Crete, Malta and Sicily.",
            "Abel suggested that the large, central nasal cavity (for the trunk) in the skull might have been interpreted as a large single eye-socket.[17] Given the inexperience of the locals with living elephants, they were unlikely to recognize the skull for what it actually was."

            "Homer does not specifically state that the cyclops, Polyphemus, has only one eye; some scholars suggest this is implied in the passage that describes Odysseus asking his men to cast lots to select a group that will join with him “to lift the stake and grind it into his eye when sweet sleep should come upon him.",
            "However others suggest that Homer’s Polyphemus may have had two eyes. It is pointed out that in the Odyssey when the actual blinding occurs there is a reference to plural brows and lids. Also Homer describes in some detail the entire race of cyclopes, critiquing their agricultural techniques, in what may be literature’s first anthropological study, and never mentions their monocularity.",
            "It is also noted that the first artistic or graphic depiction of the blinding episode appears on an amphora that was created by the Polyphemos Painter c. 680-650 B.C., and the artist shows the blinding stake has two prongs, as though two eyes are being targeted"

            "In the Theogony by Hesiod, the cyclopes – Brontes (\"thunderer\"), Steropes (\"lightning\") and the \"bright\" Arges (Greek: Βρόντης, Στερόπης and Ἄργης) – were the primordial sons of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth) and brothers of the Hekatonkheires and the Titans.",
            "As such, they were blood-related to the Titan and Olympian gods and goddesses.[10] They were giants with a single eye in the middle of their forehead and a foul disposition. According to Hesiod, they were strong and stubborn. Collectively they eventually became synonyms for brute strength and power, and their name was invoked in connection with massive masonry. They were often pictured at their forge.",
            "Uranus, fearing their strength, locked them in Tartarus. Cronus, another son of Uranus and Gaia, later freed the cyclopes, along with the Hekatonkhires, after he had overthrown Uranus. Cronus then placed them back in Tartarus, where they remained, guarded by the female monster Campe, until freed by Zeus."

            "Euripides' only extant comedy is his play Cyclops, which takes place on the island of Sicily near the volcano Mount Etna. Written in 408 B.C., it is the only complete satyr play that has survived. It is based on a story that occurs in book nine of Homer's Odyssey.",
            "The cyclops is portrayed on stage as a cave-dwelling, violent, cannibalistic, oafish character; similar to Homer’s cyclops, though it differs from the cyclops of Hesiod. Euripides’ version may also be influenced by the comic handling of the cyclops found in Cratinus’s play Odysseuses, which is one of many plays of ancient Greece that are known to have lampooned Homer’s cyclops story.",
            "According to Euripides' play Alcestis, Apollo killed the cyclopes, in retaliation for Asclepius' murder at the hands of Zeus. For this crime, Apollo was then forced into the servitude of Admetus for one year."

            "In Caucasus these tales have been handed down as songs and narrative poems by a strong oral tradition. One reason the oral tradition is strong is that for most of the languages spoken in this mountainous region there was no written alphabet until relatively recently and not exist testimonies of the period of the creation of these legends. Obviously these legends that have no connection with the ancient myths of Homer Greek myths. In the literature of ancient Greece there is no mention of the word \"Cyclops\" associated to the areas of the Caucasus.",
            "The stories are not well known to the English speaking world. They began to be written down and collected in the 1890s, as the Nart saga and the Uryzmaeg stories."
