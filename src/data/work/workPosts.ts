                "This job was a real milestone for me and it provided the perfect transition from being an amateur to being a professional web developer.",
                "The job was clean in that there was a designer who made the pages and a lead developer (website owner) who provided guidance, well outlined tasks and expert feedback throughout the development process.",
                "Before this job I had applied for a job interview in early 2016 with Porizi and the interview showed me just how bad I was at web development.  From that point on I worked everyday trying improve my overall skills but also how to rewrite my personal website in React. Once I had it rewritten in React I sent it to Porizi and then they offered me this job.",
                "Compared to what I get paid now the money was quite low but for my skills it was very fair and the feedback, guidance and self-improvement was invaluable to me at that point.",
                "The most important development skills I learnt were using git (before this I had never even used version control), Typescript, Bootstrap, and BEM scalable CSS. It was a great feeling also to know I could create something of value in the world of websites."
